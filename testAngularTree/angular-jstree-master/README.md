# Angular jstree Demo

This is a demo of a [jstree] (http://www.jstree.com/) tree component wrapped in an [AngularJS] (http://angularjs.org/) directive. The tree loads child nodes dynamically via AJAX from a simple API serving static JSON files.
                    
This demo is based on the [jstree-angular] (https://github.com/tompi/jstree-angular) directive written by [Thomas Haukland] (https://github.com/tompi).
