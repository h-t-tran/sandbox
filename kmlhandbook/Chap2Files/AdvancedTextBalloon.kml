      <em>After losing Gaia yesterday it was my mission to get her as soon
      as I could today. We were lucky to catch them fairly early in
      Kakombe.</em>
      <p>
      The two males fled down the tree, leaving Gaia as Kris charged up,
      but Gaia screamed and ran from Kris.</p>
      <p>
      Unfortunately, after they left the <em>mvule</em> tree, they headed to the
      waterfalls where they effortlesssly climbed up the vines and over
      the waterfall in a matter of seconds.</p>
